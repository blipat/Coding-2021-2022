            The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the
            browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an
            empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it
            lives inside the <head> element. It should use two attributes:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <i>href</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp; This specifies the path to the CSS file 
                        (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>rel</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp; This specifies the relationship between 
                        the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value 
                        should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.
                    </li>
                </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet. To do this it could have a &lt;link&gt;
            element for every CSS file it uses. For example, some authors use one CSS file to control the
            presentation (such as fonts and colors) and a second to control the layout.
